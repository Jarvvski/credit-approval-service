# Credit Service

To run, start the service via the gradle task:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

Or, just run the gradle task directly from your favourite IDE!

It will start the backend service up, and Hilla will compile the front-end assets from the relevant backend models and methods.

Once complete, you can navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser and have a play. Enjoy!
